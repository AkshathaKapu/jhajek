# ITMD-521 IT-D 872 Chapter-07 Lab

You will copy this template file to your own private GitHub repo provided.  Under your itmd-521 folder you will create a sub-folder named: **labs**.  Under that folder create a sub-folder named: **chapter-03**.  In that folder place this Readme.md

## Objectives

- Demonstrate creating dataframe from various file formats
- Demonstrate the advantages of "BigData" data types vs conventional text based types
- Discuss the the application of compression and its advantages in dealing with large files

### Lab

You will write one Spark application, in Java or Python that will load the sample data given from the NCDC for the decade of 1920s:

1) Parquet file (they are compressed by default)
1) Singleline lz4 compressed json
1) Singleline snappy compressed json
1) CSV snappy compressed

1) CSV non-compressed

For each of the six actions listed, in your program you will need to:

- Print the screen which item you are printing
- Print the schema
- Print the count of the number of records

#### Lab Screenshot
